# GitHub Followers

An app that uses GitHub's API to retrieve basic user information about a user. Simply type in a GitHub user's handle to see a list of the that user’s followers. Tapping on any of the followers will show their information (if provided) including full name, location, bio, public repos, public gists, followers, who they are following, and age of GitHub account. Full user profiles are accessible via the “GitHub Profile” button as a web view and a list of followers is available via the “Get Followers” button.

App users are also able to store a list of favorite GitHub users for easy access. Custom alerts provide users with valuable information such as invalid usernames, no internet connection, and when a user has been added to favorites. Local cache of avatars provides optimal app performance.
